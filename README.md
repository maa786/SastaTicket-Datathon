# SastaTicket-Datathon
Sastaticket will provide you with a train/test dataset. This synthetic dataset contains records
which act as search data. For example, if someone was to come on to Sastaticketâ€™s website and
search for a flight, this data would be recorded.
Dataset X includes the following features:
- f1: Ticket Purchase Date Time
- f2: Origin
- f3: Destination
- f4: Departure Date Time
- f5: Arrival Date Time
- f6: Airline
- f7: Refundable Ticket
- f8: Baggage Weight
- f9: Baggage Pieces
- f10: Flight Number
Dataset Y will have the following variables:
- Target
Using these features, you are expected to generate valuable insights through in-depth data
analysis. Supplement your analysis with the appropriate diagrams and make sure to dig deep
into the data as there is a lot to discover!
After conducting the exploratory analysis, you will be required to leverage these insights to
generate new features. The features you engineer will be pivotal in either making or breaking
your model.
Finally, You are expected to create a model that will output predictions against a datetime index.
The evaluation metric will be Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). This metric will be used to
evaluate the performance of your model as well as decide your position in the leaderboard.
However, RMSE is not the sole metric through which the winner will be determined.
Please keep in mind that you are required to document your journey throughout the competition.
The documentation should include the explanation of your thought process, think of it as a
journal in which you are brainstorming and a journal we are very interested in!
The winning participant/team will be decided after a thorough evaluation of the documentation,
the EDA, the final RMSE score and the efficiency of the code.
